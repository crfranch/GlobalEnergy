# GlobalEnergy
This repository has been created with the intention of seeing recent energy events through extraction of previous data and geopolitical events. 

Everything in finance is correlated with the price of oil. Based on previous trends in the economy, there is a correlation to be noted by how oil & gas work with GDP. 

This year in 2020, many have projected that by the end of the year at least 25% of the energy industry is going to be gone in the U.S. 

With this being a cyclical industry, is it right to expect a V-shaped industry?

On a high-level, what role does politics play in the supply and demand among oil & gas markets on a global level?
